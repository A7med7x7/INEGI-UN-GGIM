# Solution Documentation: 9th Place Solution

Overview

The entire solution is now contained within a single notebook, main.ipynb, which combines the functionalities originally split across three notebooks. It handles the complete process of data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction using CatBoost and Logistic Regression models. Below is a breakdown of the steps included in the consolidated solution.

main.ipynb Overview

1. Reading the Data

	•	The data is loaded and prepared for analysis.

2. Anomaly Detection with Isolation Forest

	•	Isolation Forest is applied to detect anomalies in the data.

3. Preprocessing

	•	SimpleImputer is used to fill in missing values.
	•	Backward fill (bfill) is applied to handle any additional missing data.
	•	Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used for dimensionality reduction.
	•	OneHotEncoding is performed to encode categorical features.

4. Feature Engineering

	•	New features are engineered, and some unimportant features are dropped for better performance.

5. Modeling

	•	CatBoost and Logistic Regression models are trained.
	•	Class weights are set within CatBoost to handle imbalanced classes effectively.

6. Evaluation

	•	Predictions are generated for all models, and the log loss metric is used to evaluate the models.

Combining Predictions

The predictions from different stages (previously across part1.ipynb, part2.ipynb, and part3.ipynb) are now seamlessly combined in main.ipynb:

	•	Predictions from CatBoost and Logistic Regression models are averaged to create an ensemble prediction.
	•	This ensures that the strengths of different models are leveraged for better accuracy.

Submission File Generation

	•	A submission DataFrame is created to store the predicted probabilities for each class.
	•	Using the predict_proba() method from the CatBoost model, predicted probabilities are extracted for each class and saved into the submission DataFrame.

cat_submission = pd.DataFrame({'id': id})
columns = [f'Target_{i}' for i in range(125)]
cat_submission[columns] = 0.001

y_pred_proba_cat = catBoost_model.predict_proba(X_test)
for i, class_label in enumerate(catBoost_model.classes_):
    cat_submission[f'Target_{class_label}'] = y_pred_proba_cat[:, i]

	•	Final Ensemble Submission: Predictions are averaged from different models to produce the final submission, which is saved as mean_of_all.csv.

Metric

	•	Log Loss is used to evaluate the predictions’ performance.

Future Work

	•	Data Validation: Monitor model predictions during training to identify potentially mislabeled instances. For example, predictions with high probabilities (e.g., 0.85) that turn out to be incorrect could indicate mislabeling.
	•	Hyperparameter Tuning: Explore optimization of model parameters to improve performance.
	•	Cross-Validation: Implement advanced cross-validation strategies for more stable results.
	•	Feature Engineering: Add more feature extraction and selection techniques to improve predictive accuracy.

This updated documentation reflects that the entire solution is now efficiently managed within a single notebook, main.ipynb, providing a streamlined and cohesive approach.
